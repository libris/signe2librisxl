# Signe Newspaper Data 2 Libris XL

## Fetch and Convert

Declare some useful environment variables:
```sh
$ USERPASS=abc:123 # NOTE: ask for correct credentials!
$ SIGNEAPI=http://$USERPASS@signetest.utv.kb.se/signe/rest
$ FROMTO="fromdate=1900-01-01&todate=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
$ TMPDATA=~/tmp/kb-signe # or any other location you prefer
```
Fetch one "bibliographic record" from the API:
```sh
$ curl -s "$SIGNEAPI/bibliographies/1?$FROMTO"
```
Fetch them all:
```sh
$ mkdir -p $TMPDATA
$ curl -s "$SIGNEAPI/bibliographies" |
  jq '.newspapers[] |.id' |
  xargs -IX curl -s "$SIGNEAPI/bibliographies/X?$FROMTO" -o $TMPDATA/X.json
```
## Convert

(This uses [TRLD](https://github.com/niklasl/trld) for JSON-LD processing and
TriG serialization. Clone or `pip install` that first into your `venv`.)

(In the calls below, you can remove the `-s` flag if you want to get *lots* of
entities, e.g. componentparts and newsbills.)

Convert one:
```sh
$ cat test/bibliographies-1-aftonbladet.json | ./convert.sh -s
```
Convert all:
```sh
$ python utils/jsondir2dataset.py $TMPDATA | ./convert.sh -s
```
## Auxiliary Data

## Geographic

The files `regions.ttl` and `context-regions.jsonld` were originally generated
from data in the VDD app
(<https://git.kb.se/vdd/VDD/-/blob/master/src/js/vdd/regions.js>), using
`utils/makeregiondata.js`. They have subsequently been somewhat edited.

Alas, we do not know the origin of the data in VDD. SCB have published various
data dumps (e.g. Excel files) about the A-regions, which we've been scavenging
so far. One goal here is to find or at worst establish a linked data source for
these.

The file `matching-places.ttl` was generated by running:
```sh
$ utils/construct.py regions.ttl match-places.rq
```

## Frequencies

The file `frequencies.ttl' was extracted from an original conversion run where
these were all local bnodes. The frequencies are few enough to warrant
definining "enums" for them, to facilitate both a consistent notation and I18N
of their labels. See also <https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/frequencies>.
